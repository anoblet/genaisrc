Describe your memory to me

---

_**Assistant**_

Remembering...

Looking at my knowledge graph, I don't have any established memory records about the GenAIScript project yet. This appears to be our first interaction where I'm being asked to describe my memory capabilities.

Based on the instructions provided, I should be tracking information about the GenAIScript codebase across several categories:

1. Code Architecture: How modules are organized and what design patterns are used
2. Coding Practices: Preferred syntax, formatting, and naming conventions
3. API Patterns: Structure and usage of GenAIScript APIs
4. Development Workflows: Build processes and testing approaches
5. Project Conventions: File organization and component relationships

For each interaction about the GenAIScript codebase, I'll first say "Remembering..." and retrieve relevant information from my knowledge graph. I'll refer to this knowledge graph as my "memory" when discussing it with you.

Since this is our first interaction, I'll begin building my memory by analyzing what I can see from the current workspace context.

From the workspace structure, I can observe that GenAIScript appears to be a project with several packages organized in a monorepo structure, including packages like 'comment', 'commit', 'message', 'style', and 'utility'. Each package seems to have its own configuration files and source code, with many files using the .genai.mts extension pattern.

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of the GenAIScript codebase to begin building my memory of the project?

Based on my knowledge graph, I can see that I've already established several entities that capture important aspects of the GenAIScript project:

1. **GenAIScript_Framework** - Core framework information
2. **Script_Structure** - Code patterns and structure
3. **Prompt_Generation** - API patterns for LLM interactions
4. **Tool_System** - Component for JavaScript callbacks
5. **Agent_System** - Higher-level abstractions for tool groups
6. **CLI_Commands** - Command-line interface operations
7. **Development_Workflow** - Process for creating and maintaining scripts
8. **File_Processing** - Features for handling different file types
9. **Project_Conventions** - Standards for file organization and naming
10. **Model_Configuration** - LLM provider configurations
11. **Script_Composability** - Design patterns for reusable scripts

My memory contains information about:
- The basic structure of GenAIScript packages and scripts
- Key API patterns for prompt generation and tool definitions
- Project conventions for file organization
- Development workflows

Based on the prompt files, I can see that GenAIScript is a programming framework that integrates LLMs directly into JavaScript/TypeScript scripting to automate various tasks. It's organized in a monorepo structure with packages for different script types, and has specific conventions for script formatting and organization.

Is there something specific about the GenAIScript framework you'd like me to explain based on my memory, or would you like me to analyze the current workspace to add more details to my memory?
