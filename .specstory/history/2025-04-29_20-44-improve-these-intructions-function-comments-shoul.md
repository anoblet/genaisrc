# Improve these intructions. Function comments shoul (2025-04-29 16:44:38)

_**User**_

Improve these intructions. Function comments should be only one line unless JS Doc or TS Doc are used. Use JS Doc or TS Doc wherever possible.

Remembering...

I'll help you improve the instructions in the Code Commentary Generator prompt file to emphasize single-line function comments (unless using JSDoc/TSDoc) and promote more consistent use of JSDoc/TSDoc documentation.

Let me analyze the current file and make improvements:Remembering...

Now I'll improve the instructions in the Code Commentary Generator file to emphasize single-line function comments and consistent use of JSDoc/TSDoc as requested.

# Code Commentary Generator

Add helpful and descriptive comments to the FILE_CONTENT following these guidelines:

## Comment Priority
1. Focus on complex logic and algorithms that are difficult to understand at first glance
2. Document non-obvious functionality and edge cases
3. Explain important sections and their purpose within the larger codebase
4. Clarify design patterns and architectural decisions

## Comment Style
- Use the appropriate comment syntax for the file type
- Write comments that explain WHY, not just WHAT the code does
- Keep comments concise yet informative (avoid stating the obvious)
- For general function comments, use a single line unless using formal documentation
- For JavaScript/TypeScript:
  - Use JSDoc or TSDoc for all public functions, classes, and methods
  - Use single-line comments for implementation details
  - Document parameters, return values, and potential errors in JSDoc/TSDoc
- For Python: Use docstrings (""") for modules, classes, and functions
- For C#/Java: Use XML comments
- For other languages: Follow language-specific best practices

## Examples of Good Comments
```javascript
// BAD: This function adds two numbers
// GOOD: Calculate the sum with overflow protection for large integers

// BAD: Loop through array
// GOOD: Process each transaction in chronological order to maintain state consistency

// BAD: Multiple line comments for simple functions
// function addNumbers(a, b) {
//   // This function adds two numbers
//   // It takes a and b as parameters
//   // And returns their sum
//   return a + b;
// }

// GOOD: Single line comment for simple functions
// function addNumbers(a, b) {
//   // Calculate sum, ensuring numeric conversion
//   return Number(a) + Number(b);
// }

// GOOD: JSDoc for public functions
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers with type checking and overflow protection
 * 
 * @param {number} a - First number to add
 * @param {number} b - Second number to add
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b
 * @throws {Error} When inputs are not valid numbers
 */
// function safeAdd(a, b) {
//   // Implementation details
// }
```

## Instructions
- Return the entire file with comments added
- Preserve all existing code and comments exactly as they are
- Don't modify any functionality or code structure
- Insert helpful comments where they add value
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc for all public APIs, classes, functions and methods in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use single-line comments for implementation details
- Keep comments clear and concise, don't elaborate when not needed
- If comments already exist, are up to date, and sufficient, do not add more comments

I've improved the Code Commentary Generator instructions to better emphasize the importance of single-line function comments and the consistent use of JSDoc/TSDoc documentation.

The key changes include:

1. Added a specific guideline that function comments should be single-line unless using formal documentation
2. Expanded the JavaScript/TypeScript section to clearly specify:
   - When to use JSDoc/TSDoc (for all public functions, classes, and methods)
   - When to use single-line comments (for implementation details)
   - What to document in JSDoc/TSDoc (parameters, return values, and errors)
3. Added examples showing:
   - A bad example of using multiple line comments for simple functions
   - A good example of using a single-line comment for implementation details
   - A proper JSDoc example for a public function showing complete documentation

These updates should help guide users to write more consistent and effective comments, reserving multi-line comments for formal documentation while keeping implementation notes concise.

Is there anything specific about the JSDoc/TSDoc guidelines you'd like me to adjust or expand further?
