Use the information from the first two items on the portfolio page, for the projects section on the home page.

Remembering...

I need to clarify what you're asking for. Your prompt is about using information from a "portfolio page" for a "projects section on the home page," but the context I have is about a GenAIScript project that doesn't appear to have those pages.

Could you please clarify what you mean by the portfolio page and home page in relation to the GenAIScript project? Or are you referring to a different project that isn't shown in the current workspace?
