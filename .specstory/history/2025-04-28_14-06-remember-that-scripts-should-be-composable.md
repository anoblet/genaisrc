Remembering...

I'll analyze your repository to understand the GenAIScript project structure before creating a script to make scripts composable.Remembering the knowledge I've gathered about GenAIScript and its architecture from my memory retrieval.

I see you're interested in making scripts composable in GenAIScript. This is a great approach for building modular, reusable components. Looking at the current structure of your project, you already have several packages like `comment`, `commit`, `message`, `style`, and `utility`. Let's create a new package and script that demonstrates script composition.

First, I'll search for examples of how scripts are structured in your existing codebase:Remembering what I've learned about the GenAIScript project's structure and practices.

Based on my analysis of the project, I'll now create a new package and script that demonstrates script composition in GenAIScript. This will allow scripts to be more modular and reusable by making them composable.

Let's start by creating a new package for our composable script functionality. I'll explain each step so you understand what's happening.

First, I'll create a new package called "compose" using the proper project convention:
