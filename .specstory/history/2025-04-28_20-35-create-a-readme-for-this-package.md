I'll create a README for the "style" package in the GenAIScript project.Remembering...

Now I'll check the style script to understand its purpose and functionality:Remembering...

Let me check the style prompt file to better understand what this script does:Remembering...

Based on the files I've examined, I now have a better understanding of the "style" package in the GenAIScript project. Let me create a comprehensive README for this package.

# Style

A GenAIScript package that iteratively improves code style documentation based on file examples.

## Overview

The Style script analyzes file content and uses it to improve and evolve coding style guidelines stored in a `CODE_STYLE.md` file. It's designed to learn from your codebase and iteratively enhance your code style documentation.

## Features

- Reads existing code style guidelines from `CODE_STYLE.md` in your project root
- Examines specified files as examples of ideal code
- Uses AI to iteratively improve the style guide based on the examples
- Preserves existing guidelines while adding new insights
- Updates the `CODE_STYLE.md` file with improved instructions

## Usage

### Requirements

- A `CODE_STYLE.md` file in your project root (will be created if it doesn't exist)
- Files to analyze as examples of desired code style

### Running the Script

```bash
npx genaiscript run style "src/**/*.ts"
```

This will:
1. Read your existing `CODE_STYLE.md` file
2. Analyze the provided files as examples of good code
3. Update your `CODE_STYLE.md` with improved guidelines

### Environment Variables

- `GENAISCRIPT_STYLE_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum token limit for processing (defaults to 10000)

## How It Works

The Style script:
1. Loads your existing code style guide
2. Processes each input file as an example of ideal code
3. Uses AI to identify patterns, conventions, and best practices
4. Updates your style guide to reflect these insights
5. Maintains your existing guidelines while adding improvements

## Integration with Other Tools

This script works well in your development workflow:

- Run periodically to keep style guides updated with evolving patterns
- Include in onboarding processes to document your team's coding standards
- Use before code reviews to ensure style guidelines are current

I've created a README.md file for the style package in your GenAIScript project. The README provides comprehensive documentation including:

- An overview of the Style script's purpose
- Key features of the package
- Usage instructions with examples
- Information about environment variables
- An explanation of how the script works
- Suggestions for integrating it into development workflows

The Style script is designed to iteratively improve code style documentation by analyzing example files and enhancing your `CODE_STYLE.md` file. It builds on existing guidelines rather than replacing them, learning from your codebase to create more comprehensive coding standards.

The package leverages GenAIScript's capabilities to provide an AI-assisted approach to maintaining consistent coding standards across your projects. Is there anything specific about the README you'd like me to explain or expand on?
