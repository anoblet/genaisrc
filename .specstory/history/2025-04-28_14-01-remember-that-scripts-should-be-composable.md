Remember that scripts should be composable.

I'll help you create a script that combines the content from two prompt files. Let's examine the workspace structure and understand what needs to be done.

First, let me look at the referenced files to understand what I need to create:Let me check if the referenced files exist and what they contain:I see that there's an `index.prompt.md` file that includes two other files: `./genaisrc.md` and `./memory.prompt.md`, but the search for `memory.prompt.md` didn't return any results. Let me check for the other file and also look for these files in different locations:I see that we need to create a script that can include content from multiple prompt files, but the referenced files (`./genaisrc.md` and `./memory.prompt.md`) don't seem to exist in the workspace yet. 

Let's create a GenAIScript that can handle this type of file inclusion pattern. We'll need to create a script that:

1. Reads an index file that contains `Include` directives
2. Processes these directives by reading the referenced files
3. Combines all content into a single output

Let's create this script in the `genaisrc` folder with the `.genai.mts` extension:
