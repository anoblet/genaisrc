Save to your memory that scripts should be composable.

Remembering...

I'll save this information to my memory.I apologize for the error. It seems I tried to add observations to an entity that doesn't exist yet in the knowledge graph. Let me create this entity first and then add the observations about script composability.I've saved the information about script composability to my memory. This concept is an important design pattern for GenAIScript development, where scripts should be built in a way that enables them to be combined and reused in different contexts.

The information has been stored in a new "Script_Composability" entity in my memory with the following observations:

1. Scripts should be composable, allowing them to be combined and reused in various contexts
2. Composable scripts can be used as building blocks for more complex automation workflows
3. This promotes modularity and reuse across different projects and tasks

This builds on the existing knowledge I have about the GenAIScript framework's structure and conventions. Creating composable scripts is a best practice that enhances the flexibility and maintainability of your GenAIScript projects.
