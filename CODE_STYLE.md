Additions and improvements to CODE_STYLE based on the provided FILE_CONTENT:

- Prefer environment variables for configuration, with sensible defaults.
- Parse and validate environment variables at the point of use.
- Use template literals for string interpolation, especially for dynamic values.
- Pass configuration values (like maxTokens) explicitly to functions and prompt definitions.
- Use String() for explicit type conversion when passing values to APIs that expect strings.
- Always check for empty or missing data before proceeding with main logic.
- Use early returns to handle edge cases and errors.
- Prefer single quotes for strings, but use double quotes if required by project or tooling.
- When reading files or resources, handle errors gracefully and provide clear messages.
- When invoking prompts or external APIs, group related definitions together for clarity.
- Use clear, imperative function and variable names that reflect their purpose.
- Prefer destructuring assignment for extracting values from objects or arrays.
- When exporting, use named exports for multiple exports, default export for single main export.
- Document the purpose of environment variables and configuration options in comments.
- Keep configuration and constants at the top of the file, before main logic.
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations, and handle errors with try/catch where appropriate.
- When writing output files, ensure the output is validated or sanitized if necessary.
- Use consistent formatting for function arguments and object properties, aligning for readability.
- Prefer explicitness in function calls and API usage, avoiding implicit behavior.
- Keep code modular and focused, splitting large files or functions as needed.
- Update comments and documentation to reflect changes in logic or configuration.
