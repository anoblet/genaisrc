- Prefer environment variables for configuration, providing sensible defaults and documenting their purpose.
- Parse and validate environment variables at the point of use; handle invalid or missing values gracefully.
- Use template literals for string interpolation, especially for dynamic values.
- Pass configuration values (such as maxTokens) explicitly to functions and prompt definitions.
- Use String() for explicit type conversion when passing values to APIs that expect strings.
- Always check for empty or missing data before proceeding with main logic; use early returns to handle edge cases and errors.
- Prefer single quotes for strings, unless double quotes are required by project or tooling.
- When reading files or resources, handle errors gracefully and provide clear, actionable messages.
- Group related prompt or API definitions together for clarity.
- Use clear, imperative function and variable names that reflect their purpose.
- Prefer destructuring assignment for extracting values from objects or arrays.
- Use named exports for multiple exports, default export for a single main export.
- Keep configuration and constants at the top of the file, before main logic.
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations, handling errors with try/catch where appropriate.
- When writing output files, validate or sanitize output as necessary.
- Use consistent formatting for function arguments and object properties, aligning for readability.
- Prefer explicitness in function calls and API usage, avoiding implicit behavior.
- Keep code modular and focused, splitting large files or functions as needed.
- Update comments and documentation to reflect changes in logic or configuration.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration or constants instead.
- Use clear log messages for user-facing output, especially for error or status reporting.
- Ensure all asynchronous operations are awaited to avoid unhandled promise rejections.
- Document the purpose and usage of each exported function.
- Structure scripts to allow for easy extension or modification of configuration and logic.
